### Day 4: April 25, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Day with lots of non-coding things to do, but I squeezed an hour of coding before laying to sleep. Started building an Pomodoro Timer with HTML, CSS and JS. More about this project in the coming days.

### Day 6: April 27, 2022

**Today's Progress**: A lot of JS study today, I coded less, but learned a lot.

**Thoughts:** I had problems sleeping the last few days, so today I tried not to drink any coffee in the afternoon, and I guess it worked! Gonna get a decaf tomorrow.


### Day 7: April 28, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today I get an old Rock Paper Scissors project that I made a couple of years ago, and started refactoring. A lot of work. The good thing is that I could see how much I've improved. I fixed a lot of things, and tomorrow I'll try to refactor to what I studied today.

**Thoughts:** Today was very demanding for my brain. I had the first contact with Factories, Declarative Programming, ES6 Modules.

### Day 8: April 29, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Did my first factory, and got the seconds countdown working. Not much time to code today.

**Thoughts:** I'm not really well today, but the #100DaysOfCode made me code today, thanks for that.


### Day 9: April 30, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I managed to squeeze a little bit of code at the end of the day, but forgot to update here! initial logic of the Pomo Focus Timer done. Tomorrow (or today?), begin refactoring.

**Thoughts:** The reason I forgot was that after I coded, I lay down to take a nap. This nap transformed in a deep sleep of which I only wake up today!


### Day 10: May 1, 2022

**Today's Progress**: A day with a lot of revision and practice of ES6 modules, refactoring Pomo Focus Timer.

**Today's Progress**: This week will be focused in build the project of the #NextLevelWeekReturn from @Rocketseat.

**Today's Progress**: Finished the 2nd day of the #NextLevelWeek. Plenty of new front-end concepts and tips.

**Today's Progress**: Finished the 3rd day of the #NextLevelWeek. A lot of CSS bug fix, with a little bit of HTML and JS for now.

### Day 17: May 9, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Made a lot of factories, dependency injection and debuggind of Pomo Focus Timer!

**Thoughts:** Today I try too hard some bugfix and refactoring. I have to stay alert to not overdo. Sometimes it's better to take a step back and come back later.

### Day 18: May 11, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Not much progress, I got sick yesterday, didn't manage to code at all. Working on the Pomo Focus 2.0, with individual buttons for bg sounds.

**Thoughts:** I got a really heavy virus yesterday, I'm still not 100%, maybe 60%.


### Day 19: May 12, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I spend half an hour constructing a function to get an array of elements of a class and identify which one is and add the hover color to it when clicked. And the rest was with css.

**Thoughts:** It was very satisfying getting the function right only on my research, it took a little while but I did it!


### Day 20: May 13, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Very good day of coding. Finished beta of PomoFocusTimer2.0. With differents bg audios and option to add/remove minutes on the go.

### Day 22: May 16, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Studied SPAs and coded an example page html only.

**Thoughts:** Today was full of new concepts and ways of thinking JS and web development. Very nice!


### Day 23: May 17, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Began development of an SPA application with use of API to mark favorite Github users.

**Thoughts:** Still wrapping my head around the concepts from yesterday, putting then to use and practicing.


### Day 24: May 18, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Working on update, load, delete functions and API access to Github-favorites.

**Thoughts:** A lot of new concepts to learn, gotta practice and read about then a lot to internalize.


### Day 25: May 19, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Updated Github favorites to update de UI of the page, and also studied error treatment.

**Thoughts:** With a little bit of practice everyday some things are starting to make sense!


### Day 26: May 20, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the beta version of GitHub-Favorites, with API fetch from Github and save/delete error treatment in place.

**Thoughts:** A lot of things that I donÂ´t fully understand yet, but that makes sense in the scale of the project.


### Day 27: May 21, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Got back to the Pomo Focus Timer, to use input range as volume slider and do a dark and clear theme with a swith to change between them.

**Thoughts:** Had to redo a lot of the logic behind the buttons and elements, but the timer portion stayed the same, and modularize the different portions of the project made a lot easier to change something without affecting the whole project. 


### Day 28: May 22, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished challenges on PomoFocusTimer, separate audio sliders for volume control of each sound, and dark mode.

**Thoughts:** What I was doing before was very complicated, I simplified a lot of the code doing most of the styling through css only, saving a few for Javascript, it's a lot better now, and more modularized.

### Day 29: May 23, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Returned to studying SPAs, with a new simple project of a few pages in a SPA with informations about the universe.

### Day 30: May 24, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the beta version of the SPA about the Universe, with css styles and logic done.

**Thoughts:** Not much time to study today, but I managed to squeeze a couple of hours in between jobs.


### Day 32: May 26, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Begin the revamp of Github Favorites style.

**Thoughts:** Today I got beaten really hard by stylization of tables in css. Reminded me when I started. Definitely have to study more of that.


### Day 33: May 30, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Began buildingan API project about movie rating! Build the folder structure, and put the server on with NodeJS and Express.

**Thoughts:** Restarting after one month away due to the birth of my first child! No worries, I'm happy to restart, and follow the rules of the initiative.


### Day 2: July 5, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Done Controllers and Routes, imported knex and organized the migrations, db, made the first method of the movie and the user, create.

**Thoughts:** I don't have any previous experience with NodeJS and API building, only SQL and DBs, so a lot of new things to work with, but supported by some previous knowledge of how the insides work.


### Day 3: July 6, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Worked on methods to the movies, users and tags controllers, adding filter options to movies. Also adjusted some commands of the database.

**Thoughts:** On the finish line to temporary finish the API, is comming along very well.

**Thoughts:** Little time to code, but I managed to do it.


### Day 5: July 8, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Began learning ReactJS, and the first project also started development. But I focused on the "how it works" before jumping into it.

**Thoughts:** I have a feeling that my work in continuously studying ES6 a month ago will pay off here, a lot of things relating.


### Day 6: July 9, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Continued development on ReactJS project, using components to build an Notes App (Front-end to the API built last week).

**Thoughts:** React is very different from "normal" js, so it takes some time to grasp the meaning of what you're doing when starting out.


### Day 7: July 11, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Built Button, Header and Section components, and learn how to import icons from React Icons.

**Thoughts:** With the practice, all is starting to make sense. And Sundays are for my baby girl now, sorry!


### Day 8: July 12, 2022

**Today's Progress**: First page completed, with all components ready for reutilization.

**Thoughts:** A lot of repetition helps a lot to absorb the organization and structure that React demands!
