# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 22, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Done the first challenge of the Explorer Stage 04, Basic Javascript.

**Thoughts:** When trying to update Ubuntu, it froze and I lost the install, gonna have to reinstall everything tomorrow, only coded in the Windows today, as a backup.

### Day 2: April 23, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Done the second challenge of the Explorer Stage 04, Basic JS, compute student's average grades. Warming up!

**Thoughts:** Following the disastrous ubuntu update, big part of today's schedule was installing things and reconfiguring terminal and git, among other things.

### Day 3: April 24, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Productive day, made the first 2 freeCodeCamp projects for the Responsive Web Design certification, a lot of HTML and CSS to review.

### Day 4: April 25, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Day with lots of non-coding things to do, but I squeezed an hour of coding before laying to sleep. Started building an Pomodoro Timer with HTML, CSS and JS. More about this project in the coming days.

**Thoughts:** Nothing really, an allergy hit me at dawn, and I took an medicine that puts me to bed in no time, I'm already sleepwalking. See ya tomorrow, gotta sleep!


### Day 5: April 26, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I coded a lot in between tasks at work, managed to finish the 3rd freeCodeCamp Project. Link Below! (still missing some things, like animations or proper responsiveness).

**Thoughts:** I put off the project I started yesterday because I forgot to commit from home to continue from work! haha

### Day 6: April 27, 2022

**Today's Progress**: A lot of JS study today, I coded less, but learned a lot.

**Thoughts:** I had problems sleeping the last few days, so today I tried not to drink any coffee in the afternoon, and I guess it worked! Gonna get a decaf tomorrow.


### Day 7: April 28, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today I get an old Rock Paper Scissors project that I made a couple of years ago, and started refactoring. A lot of work. The good thing is that I could see how much I've improved. I fixed a lot of things, and tomorrow I'll try to refactor to what I studied today.

**Thoughts:** Today was very demanding for my brain. I had the first contact with Factories, Declarative Programming, ES6 Modules.
