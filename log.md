### Day 4: April 25, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Day with lots of non-coding things to do, but I squeezed an hour of coding before laying to sleep. Started building an Pomodoro Timer with HTML, CSS and JS. More about this project in the coming days.

**Thoughts:** Nothing really, an allergy hit me at dawn, and I took an medicine that puts me to bed in no time, I'm already sleepwalking. See ya tomorrow, gotta sleep!

### Day 6: April 27, 2022

**Today's Progress**: A lot of JS study today, I coded less, but learned a lot.

**Thoughts:** I had problems sleeping the last few days, so today I tried not to drink any coffee in the afternoon, and I guess it worked! Gonna get a decaf tomorrow.


### Day 7: April 28, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today I get an old Rock Paper Scissors project that I made a couple of years ago, and started refactoring. A lot of work. The good thing is that I could see how much I've improved. I fixed a lot of things, and tomorrow I'll try to refactor to what I studied today.

**Thoughts:** Today was very demanding for my brain. I had the first contact with Factories, Declarative Programming, ES6 Modules.

### Day 8: April 29, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Did my first factory, and got the seconds countdown working. Not much time to code today.

**Thoughts:** I'm not really well today, but the #100DaysOfCode made me code today, thanks for that.


### Day 9: April 30, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I managed to squeeze a little bit of code at the end of the day, but forgot to update here! initial logic of the Pomo Focus Timer done. Tomorrow (or today?), begin refactoring.

**Thoughts:** The reason I forgot was that after I coded, I lay down to take a nap. This nap transformed in a deep sleep of which I only wake up today!


### Day 10: May 1, 2022

**Today's Progress**: A day with a lot of revision and practice of ES6 modules, refactoring Pomo Focus Timer.

**Thoughts:** A very good day in general, I managed to rest well and prepare for the week ahead! 10% done!


### Day 11: May 3, 2022

**Today's Progress**: This week will be focused in build the project of the #NextLevelWeekReturn from @Rocketseat.

**Thoughts:** The day before When I sat down on my chair to code, a blackout ocurred! From 20:30 to 2:40 without electricity, but today I compensate and done a lot of work!


### Day 12: May 4, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the 2nd day of the #NextLevelWeek. Plenty of new front-end concepts and tips.

### Day 13: May 5, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the 3rd day of the #NextLevelWeek. A lot of CSS bug fix, with a little bit of HTML and JS for now.

**Thoughts:** I'm happy with the time I put into coding today, and with the problems that I was able to solve, using analytic view, think and testing until I realized what was wrong.

**Today's Progress**: Made a lot of factories, dependency injection and debuggind of Pomo Focus Timer!

### Day 18: May 11, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Not much progress, I got sick yesterday, didn't manage to code at all. Working on the Pomo Focus 2.0, with individual buttons for bg sounds.

**Thoughts:** I got a really heavy virus yesterday, I'm still not 100%, maybe 60%.


### Day 19: May 12, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I spend half an hour constructing a function to get an array of elements of a class and identify which one is and add the hover color to it when clicked. And the rest was with css.

**Thoughts:** It was very satisfying getting the function right only on my research, it took a little while but I did it!


### Day 20: May 13, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Very good day of coding. Finished beta of PomoFocusTimer2.0. With differents bg audios and option to add/remove minutes on the go.
